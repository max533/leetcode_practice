# 1002. Find Common Characters

[Problem Source](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-characters/)

## 1. Description

Given an array A of strings made only from lowercase letters, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list **(including duplicates)**.  For example, if a character occurs 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character three times in the final answer.

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**

```text
Input: ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

**Example 2:**

```text
Input: ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

**Constraints:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 100`
3. `A[i][j]` is a lowercase letter

## 2. Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, A: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        common_part = []
        for word in set(A[0]):
            counter = [string.count(word) for string in A]
            common_part_times = min(counter) 
            for i in range(common_part_times):
                common_part.append(word)
        return common_part
```
